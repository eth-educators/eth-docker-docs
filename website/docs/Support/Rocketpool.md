RocketPool node and eth-docker solo staking, it's like peanut butter and jelly. Both use docker, and they integrate seamlessly.

I'll be showing two configurations: Chain databases in Rocketpool, and chain databases in eth-docker.

This has been tested with Lighthouse. It should work without changes for any client that Rocketpool supports. Prysm compatibility is not guaranteed as of RocketPool 1.3.0.

## Configuration A: Chain databases in RocketPool

For this example, the consensus client (beacon/eth2) and execution client (eth1) will run in RocketPool, and eth-docker will run just a validator client, but not "consensus" or "execution" containers.

### Configure RocketPool

If you are not running RocketPool already, install it [following their instructions](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/docker.html). When you get to the step where you configure RocketPool:

`rocketpool service config` and choose Locally Managed, any local Execution Client (Geth, Erigon, etc) and any Consensus Client, though I'd avoid Prysm.

Run `rocketpool service start`, and everything should come up. 

You can continue following the Rocketpool instructions at this point.

### Configure eth-docker

If you are not running eth-docker already, grab it with `git clone https://github.com/eth2-educators/eth-docker.git && cd eth-docker`.

Configure it with `./ethd config`. Make sure to choose the same Ethereum PoS network as RocketPool, and a "Validator client only" to match the Consensus client in RocketPool. Choose "http://eth2:5052" as your "remote consensus client".

> Lighthouse and Teku are mutually compatible, they can be mixed and matched
> Prysm support has not been tested

If you had previously already imported keys to eth-docker, restart eth-docker with `./ethd restart`.

Optional cleanup: If you had chain databases in eth-docker previously, do a `docker volume ls` and then `docker volume rm` the consensus/beacon and eth1/ec volumes, e.g. `eth-docker_geth-eth1-data` and `eth-docker_lhbeacon-data`.

### Import solo staking keys

If you haven't already imported validator keys to eth-docker, do so now. You will need the `keystore-m` files and their
password.

- Copy `keystore-m` files to `.eth/validator_keys` in the eth-docker directory
- From the eth-docker directory, start eth-docker: `./ethd up`
- Import keys and follow prompts: `./ethd keys import`
- Verify keys came in: `./ethd keys list`

### Check logs

You expect `./ethd logs -f validator` to show a successful connection. 

`rocketpool service logs validator` should show the validator connecting to its own consensus client.
`docker ps` should show `rocketpool_eth1` and `rocketpool_eth2` containers, but no `consensus` or `execution` containers for eth-docker.

## Configuration B: Chain databases in eth-docker

For this example, the consensus client (beacon/eth2) and execution client (eth1) will run in eth-docker, as well as the solo staking validator client, and RocketPool will run its own validator client as well as its node container, but not "eth1" or "eth2" containers.

### Configure RocketPool

If you are not running RocketPool already, install it [following their instructions](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/docker.html). When you get to the step where you configure RocketPool:

- `rocketpool service config` and choose `Externally Managed` for the Execution Client, and as your http URL use `http://execution:8545` and as the websocket URL use `ws://execution:8546`. Choose `None` for your fallback client. Choose `Externally Managed` for the Consensus Client, and choose the client you want to run in eth-docker. As the http URL use `http://consensus:5052`. This requires a client that has a standalone validator client available: As of April 2022, your choices are Lighthouse, Teku and Prysm. I advise against choosing a majority client, which as of April 2022 is Prysm.

Set up eth-docker next before following the rest of the Rocketpool instructions.

### Configure eth-docker

If you are not running eth-docker already, grab it with `git clone https://github.com/eth2-educators/eth-docker.git && cd eth-docker`, and configure it with `./ethd config`. Choose an Ethereum node deployment. Make sure to choose the same Ethereum PoS network and consensus client as you chose in RocketPool. It *should* work with any execution client, but I've only tested it with Geth so far.

Connect eth-docker to RocketPool's docker network.

- `nano .env` and add `:ext-network.yml` to `COMPOSE_FILE`
- `nano ext-network.yml` and change the line that reads `name: traefik_default` to `name: rocketpool_net`
- `./ethd start` or, if you already have eth-docker running, `./ethd update` followed by `./ethd up`
- `rocketpool service start` and Rocketpool should come up

You can continue following the Rocketpool instructions at this point.

### Import solo staking keys

If you haven't already imported validator keys to eth-docker, do so now. You will need the `keystore-m` files and their
password.

- Copy `keystore-m` files to `.eth/validator_keys` in the eth-docker directory
- From the eth-docker directory, start eth-docker: `./ethd up`
- Import keys and follow prompts: `./ethd keys import`
- Verify keys came in: `./ethd keys list`

### Check logs

`./ethd logs -f consensus` should show it starting up, ditto `./ethd logs -f execution`, and after consensus is up, you expect
`./ethd logs -f validator` to show a successful connection. Solo staking is (still) working.

`rocketpool service logs validator` should show the validator connecting to your consensus client.
`docker ps` should show no `rocketpool_eth1` or `rocketpool_eth2` containers.
