## Updating the project

> `sudo` for docker compose commands is only necessary if your user is *not* part of the `docker` group

To update the components of the project, run from within the project directory (`cd ~/eth-docker` by default):

* `./ethd update`. This fetches new client version(s), a new eth-docker, and updates `.env`, keeping your modifications. If you want to reset the source or binary build targets in `.env`, run `./ethd update --refresh-targets` instead.
* **Only** if you are using source builds: `./ethd cmd build --pull --no-cache`
* `./ethd up` - use the new client version(s)

> On 1/27/2022, eth-docker's repository name changed. Everything should work as it did.
> If you do wish to manually update your local reference, run `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/eth-educators/eth-docker.git`

* Fixed ec-traefik.yml

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains new features*

* Added Grafana metrics for Erigon

*This is a bugfix upgrade*

* `./ethd config` can correctly configure Teku Rapid Sync again

## v1.2.5.1 2021-06-06

*This is a bugfix upgrade*

* `./ethd` help screen works again
* `sudo ./ethd terminate` command introduced

## v1.2.5 2021-06-05

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains new features*

* Erigon (still in alpha) now syncs a pruned DB
* `./ethd config` now queries the user for desired Graffiti
* `sudo ./ethd update` now does a root-safe `git pull` to update eth-docker itself, and uses a different mechanism to redirect error messages for `docker-compose pull`, so it can update components like `node-exporter` with good UX.

## v1.2.4 2021-06-05

*This is a bugfix upgrade*

* `./ethd update` no longer attempts to `docker-compose pull` or `git pull`. In some instances the expected error messages from `docker-compose pull` were not redirected to `/dev/null`, and updating ancillary components while throwing a bevy of error messages is terrible UX.

## v1.2.3 2021-06-04

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains new features*

* `./ethd update` now migrates `.env` variables

## v1.2.2 2021-06-03

## v1.2.0 2021-05-28

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains new features*

* This release contains breaking changes to `.env`. Please recreate it from `default.env`, see above.
* All v1.x releases change the docker images used to run your node. Please be sure to `docker-compose build --pull`
  before (re)starting your node software.

* Renamed all eth1/beacon references to execution/consensus, to fit with the new naming conventions
put forth by the Ethereum developers
* Note this change will cause warning messages, as both `ETH1_` and `EC_` variable names are supported. This
backwards compatibility will be removed after "Altair", expected August 2021

* Removed OpenEthereum from `./ethd config` as a choice. OpenEthereum will remain a supported execution
client until Shanghai, to give users time to migrate.

## v1.1.0 2021-05-12

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains new features*

* This release contains breaking changes to `.env`. Please recreate it from `default.env`, see above.

* If you are using any version prior to v1.0.0 released 2021-05-06: PLEASE UPDATE BEFORE October 2021.
  The script that adjusts permissions for existing setups will be removed again at that point, and
  any setups that haven't updated by then would have permissions issues when they do update.

## v1.0.0 2021-05-06

*This is an optional upgrade, that contains bugfixes and new features*

With funding from the Ethereum Foundation, we are at v1.0.0! This update makes significant changes to
the way permissions are handled. While this should improve your experience, please be aware that your `.env` file
should likely be re-created with a fresh copy of `default.env`, and your specific changes copied in. See above for
instructions.

* `LOCAL_UID` is no longer being used in `.env`
* Beacon and Ethereum node containers now run with a "high" user ID, not the user ID of the logged-in user. In
  order to make this seamless, they use a docker-entrypoint script that changes permissions of existing setups
  on the fly
* PLEASE UPDATE BEFORE October 2021. The entrypoint script will be removed again at that point, and
  any setups that haven't updated by then would have permissions issues when they do update.
* Prysm now runs on the Prater testnet without the need to manually pass in the genesis state
* Source builds for Nimbus, Prysm have been fixed; all source builds tested
* `docker-compose build --pull` is now much faster
* deposit-cli has been removed from the `CLIENT-base.yml` files. If you do wish to use it, rather than
  generating keys offline, please add `deposit-cli.yml` to `COMPOSE_FILE`
* deposit-cli services have been renamed to `deposit-cli-new` and `deposit-cli-existing`
* The `validator-voluntary-exit` service has been renamed to just `validator-exit`
* Support for voluntary validator exit when using Teku
* Preliminary beta configuration script, run `./eth2d.sh` for a quick setup

* Added support for new Teku 21.4.1 features: eth1 failover endpoints, and rapid weak subjectivity sync from infura eth2 project

## v0.3.0 2021-04-21

*This is an optional upgrade, that adds new features*

* Added Traefik reverse proxy for secure access to Grafana and Prysm Web, even eth1 clients. Note this is
  a breaking change for existing Grafana, Prysm Web and shared/standalone eth1 clients. You will need to
  add `grafana-insecure.yml`, `prysm-web-insecure.yml`, `eth1-insecure.yml`, depending on service you use,
  to your `COMPOSE_FILE` inside `.env`. Alternatively and recommended, add `traefik-cf.yml` or `traefik-aws.yml`
  and start using secure https:// ! Please see [reverse proxy instructions](../Usage/ReverseProxy.md).
* Added wizard.sh shell script for quick initial setup
* Added node reporter Grafana dashboard to alert on low CPU, Memory or Disk Space

* Handles Terms Of Service for Prysm, user is prompted during validator-import, and choice is remembered
* If you are upgrading this project and you are using Prysm, please run `sudo docker-compose run validator`
  and accept the terms of use. You can then Ctrl-C that process and start up normally again. This step
  is not necessary if you are starting from scratch.

## v0.1.6 2020-10-09

* Support for Lighthouse v0.3.0, drop support for v0.2.x
  * Please note that Lighthouse v0.3.x makes a breaking change to the beacon
    db. You will need to sync again from scratch, after building the new v0.3.0
    beacon image. You can force this with 
    `sudo docker-compose down`, `sudo docker volume rm eth2-docker_lhbeacon-data`
    (adjust to your directory path if you are not in `eth2-docker`, see
    `sudo docker volume ls` for a list).
  * Likewise, the location of the validator keystore has changed. The fastest way
    to resolve this involves importing the keystore from scratch:
    `sudo docker volume rm eth2-docker_lhvalidator-data` (as before, adjust for
    your directory), and then import the keystore(s) again with
    `sudo docker-compose run validator-import`. Your keystore(s) need to be in
    `.eth2/validator_keys` inside the project directory for that.
  * When you have completed the above steps, bring up Lighthouse with
    `sudo docker-compose up -d eth2` and verify that the beacon started syncing
    and the validator found its public key(s) by observing logs:<br />
    `sudo docker-compose logs -f beacon` and `sudo docker-compose logs validator | head -30`,
    and if you wish to see ongoing validator logs, `sudo docker-compose logs -f validator`.
  * The beacon will sync from scratch, which will take about half a day. Your
    validator will be marked offline for that duration.
