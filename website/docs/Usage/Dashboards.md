## Choose local or cloud Grafana

You have a choice of running Grafana locally, by including `grafana.yml`, or in the cloud, with `grafana-cloud.yml`.
If you choose Grafana Cloud, you **must** edit `prometheus/custom-prom.yml` and add your cloud remote write
credentials. Please see `prometheus/custom-prom.yml.sample` for the syntax of that addition.

`grafana-cloud.yml` runs a local Prometheus but no local Grafana, and enables adding custom Prometheus config items.
Its contents are merged with the pre-provisioned configuration.

If you want to add additional scrape targets, place these into `prometheus/conf.d`.

## Local Grafana dashboards

A baseline set of dashboards has been included.

- [Prysm Dashboard JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuillaumeMiralles/prysm-grafana-dashboard/master/less_10_validators.json)

You can additional dashboards from the Grafana repository, for example `11133` as a node exporter dashboard. You can
also import dashboards by their JSON, as you see fit.

## Connecting to local Grafana  

Connect to https://grafana.yourdomain.com/ (or http://YOURSERVERIP:3000/ if not using the reverse proxy), log in as
admin/admin, and set a new password.

> If you run Grafana over http without encryption, do not expose the Grafana port to the Internet. You can
> use [SSH tunneling](https://www.howtogeek.com/168145/how-to-use-ssh-tunneling/) to reach Grafana securely over the Internet.

In order to load other Dashboards, follow these instructions.

- Click on the + icon on the left, choose "Import".
- Copy/paste JSON code from the Raw github page of the Dashboard you chose - click anywhere inside the page, use Ctrl-A
to select all and Ctrl-C to copy
- Click "Load"
- If prompted for a data source choose the "prometheus" data source
- Click "Import".

## Alerting with Grafana

Grafana supports setting up alerts and sending notifications to email, Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, etc. Some alerts
are pre-previsioned.

To receive these alerts, use the alert bell icon on the left-hand side and set up contact points and notification
policies. The pre-provisioned alerts use a `severity` label. You could for example send `medium` severity alerts to
email, Discord or Telegram, and `critical` severity alerts to PagerDuty or OpsGenie.
